# Plan

## Success

I := π written ∧ ## Task IDs section ∃
V := `ls artifacts/plans/{N}-*.mdx` ∧ `grep "## Task IDs" artifacts/plans/{N}-*.mdx`

Let:
  σ := spec artifact
  π := plan artifact at `artifacts/plans/{issue}-{slug}.mdx`
  τ := tier ∈ {S, F-lite, F-full}

Spec → micro-tasks → agent assignments → plan artifact.

**Flow: single continuous pipeline. ¬stop between steps. Decision response → immediately execute next step. Stop only on: Cancel/Abort or Step 6 completion.**

```
/plan --issue 42         Generate plan from spec for issue #42
/plan --spec path        Generate plan from explicit spec path
/plan --issue 42 --audit Show reasoning checkpoint before planning
```

## Pipeline

| Step | ID | Required | Verifies via | Notes |
|------|----|----------|---------------|-------|
| 1 | locate-spec | ✓ | σ ∃ | — |
| 2 | plan | ✓ | τ + agents defined | — |
| 3 | refs | — | ref paths noted | — |
| 4 | micro-tasks | — | tasks ∃ in π | Tier F only |
| 5 | write | ✓ | π ∃ | — |
| 6 | approve | ✓ | `git log` shows commit | gate |

## Pre-flight

Success: π written ∧ ## Task IDs section ∃
Evidence: `grep "## Task IDs" artifacts/plans/{N}-*.mdx`
Steps: locate-spec → plan → refs → micro-tasks → write → approve
¬clear → STOP + ask: "Do you have a spec to plan from?"

## Step 1 — Locate Spec

`--issue N` → `ls artifacts/specs/N-*.mdx` → read full → extract title, criteria, files.
`--spec <path>` → read directly.
¬found → suggest `/spec` or `/dev`. **Stop.**

### Pre-flight: Ambiguity Check

Grep `\[NEEDS CLARIFICATION` in σ (count).
count > 0 → → DP(A) **Resolve now** | **Return to spec** | **Proceed anyway**

## Step 2 — Plan

Read `docs/processes/dev-process.mdx` + σ.

### Step 2a-pre — Reasoning Audit (optional)

`--audit` → after reading σ, present reasoning audit per [reasoning-audit.md](${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/shared/references/reasoning-audit.md) (plan guidance).
→ → DP(A) **Proceed** | **Adjust approach** | **Abort**
¬`--audit` → continue to Step 2a.

**2a. Scope:** Glob + Grep → files to create/modify + reference features for patterns.

**2b. Tier:** S | F-lite | F-full per dev-process.mdx. ∃ `artifacts/frames/` ∧ `tier` field → use it. Else assess from σ complexity.

**2c. Agents:**

| Path prefix | Agent |
|------------|-------|
| `{frontend.path}`, `{shared.ui}` | frontend-dev |
| `{backend.path}`, `{shared.types}` | backend-dev |
| `{shared.config}`, root configs | devops |
| `docs/` | doc-writer |

Paths from stack.yml. ¬set → file domain heuristics (component/hook → FE; service/controller/route → BE).

Always: **tester**. Add: architect (new modules), security-auditor (auth/validation), doc-writer (new APIs).
τ=S → skip agent assignment (single session).

Intra-domain parallel: ≥3 independent tasks in 1 domain → multiple same-type agents (F-lite ∧ F-full). Shared barrel files → merge into single agent.

**Subject-surface cap (per instance):** ∀ agent instance, tag each task with 1 subject (e.g. auth, cache, http, migrations, parser, dispatch). Distinct subjects per instance > 2 → **force-split** into a new instance (`backend-dev-A` → `backend-dev-A` + `backend-dev-B`). Reason: instance ≈ session ≈ context window — too many surfaces dilute focus and tail-degrade output.

**2d. Tasks:** ∀ task: description, files, agent, dependencies, parallel-safe (Y/N).
Order: types → backend → frontend → tests → docs → config.

**Budget heuristic (ops estimate):** After listing tasks, classify each by cost class and compute estimated tool-call ops. Record in the plan artifact's Wave Structure section as a Budget Table.

Cost classes:

| Class | Ops/item | Examples |
|-------|----------|---------|
| `trivial` | 1–2 | string replace, single grep |
| `bounded` | 2–3 | read + edit known file |
| `judgmental` | 4–6 | read + context + judge + edit |
| `exploratory` | 8–15 | open-ended cross-file search |

Rules:
1. **Per-task cap:** `estimated_total_ops > 50` for a task → **force-split** the task into smaller sub-tasks, or present a DP(A) **Split now** | **Keep as-is (flag)** decision before proceeding.
2. **Per-instance cap:** after agent_instance assignment, aggregate ops per instance. `Σ ops/instance > 50` OR `|tasks/instance| > 4` OR `distinct subjects/instance > 2` → **force-split** into a new instance (`backend-dev-A` → `backend-dev-A` + `backend-dev-B`). This catches the case where each task is small but stacking 6 tasks on one agent overflows its context.

**2e. Slice Selection (multi-slice only):** ≥2 slices → → DP(C) 1 option/slice `V{N}: {desc} ({files}, {agents})`.
Default: next unimplemented slice. Respect deps. Re-run `/plan` for remaining.

**2f. Present Plan:** → DP(A) τ, slices, files, agents, tasks with `[parallel-safe: Y/N]`.
Options: **Approve** | **Modify** | **Cancel**
**Approve → immediately continue to Step 3 (¬stop).**

## Step 3 — Ref Patterns

Find similar existing feature → read 1–2 files for conventions. Store paths → note in π for Step 4 agent context injection.

## Step 4 — Micro-Tasks (Tier F only)

τ=S → skip → Step 5. Read [references/micro-tasks.md](${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/micro-tasks.md) for complete process.

**Summary:** Detect σ format (Breadboard+Slices ∨ Success Criteria) → generate micro-tasks with verify commands → detect parallelization → scale task count → consistency check (σ↔tasks bidirectional) → write to π.

Key outputs: micro-tasks with fields below, `[P]` parallel markers, RED-GATE sentinels per slice.

See [references/micro-task-example.mdx](${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/micro-task-example.mdx) for a worked example.

### Micro-Task Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Description | Imperative, specific |
| File path | Target file |
| Code snippet | Expected shape skeleton |
| Verify command | Bash confirmation |
| Expected output | Success criteria |
| Time estimate | 2–5 min (up to 8–10 for atomic ops) |
| `[P]` marker | Parallel-safe |
| Agent | Owner |
| Agent instance | Named owner (backend-dev-A, tester-B, ...) |
| Subject | 1-word surface tag (auth, cache, http, parser, …) — used for per-instance subject-diversity cap |
| Spec trace | SC-N ∨ U1→N1→S1 |
| Slice | V1, V2, ... |
| Phase | RED ∨ GREEN ∨ REFACTOR ∨ RED-GATE |
| Difficulty | 1–5 |

## Step 5 — Write Plan Artifact

Write to `artifacts/plans/{N}-{slug}-plan.mdx`. Create `artifacts/plans/` dir if needed.

Use [references/plan-template.mdx](${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/plan-template.mdx). See [references/micro-task-example.mdx](${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/micro-task-example.mdx) for task formatting.

```markdown
---
title: "Plan: {title}"
issue: {N}
spec: artifacts/specs/{N}-{slug}-spec.mdx
complexity: {score}/10
tier: {τ}
generated: {ISO}
---
```

Include:
- Summary (1–2 sentences)
- Architecture diagrams (mermaid, see below)
- Bootstrap Context (from analysis if ∃, omit if ¬∃)
- Agents table (agent, task count, files)
- Wave Structure table (see below)
- Consistency Report (covered/total, uncovered, untraced, exemptions)
- Micro-Tasks (grouped by slice/criteria, with RED-GATE sentinels)
- Task Seeding Blueprint (see below)

### Mermaid Diagrams

`## Architecture` must include:
1. **Data flow** (`flowchart TD`) — full pipeline: config files → loader functions → data structures → composition → runtime injection. Group nodes into subgraphs by file. Highlight key paths with distinct styles.
2. **File × Function map** (`flowchart LR`) — functions/classes per file, call relationships. Group by source file. Show test files as consumers.

Diagrams go AFTER Summary, BEFORE Bootstrap Context.

### Wave Structure

After micro-tasks, derive waves from the dependency graph. Name parallel agent instances (tester-A/B, backend-dev-A/B/C, devops-A/B) so `/implement` can spawn distinct agents per wave. Include this table in π:

```markdown
## Wave Structure

{N} waves, max {K} parallel agents. Elapsed ~{X} weeks vs ~{Y} sequential.

| Wave | Trigger | Agents | Tasks |
|------|---------|--------|-------|
| 1 | start | {K} ∥ | {agent-A}: T{n} · {agent-B}: T{m} |
| 2 | Wave 1 done | {K} ∥ | ... |
```

After the wave table, include a **Budget Table** derived from Step 2d classification — both per-task AND per-instance rollups:

```markdown
### Budget — per task

| Task | Items | Class | Est. ops | Split? |
|------|-------|-------|----------|--------|
| {task name} | {N} | {class} | {ops} | — |
| {large task} | {N} | exploratory | {ops} | YES — split required |

**Total estimated ops: {total}**

### Budget — per agent instance

| Instance | Tasks | Σ ops | Subjects | Split? |
|----------|-------|-------|----------|--------|
| backend-dev-A | T1, T2, T3 | 18 | auth, sessions | — |
| backend-dev-B | T4, T5, T6, T7, T8 | 36 | cache, http, rate-limit | YES — \|tasks\|=5 > 4 ∧ subjects=3 > 2 |
| tester-A | T9, T10 | 12 | auth | — |
```

Tasks marked `YES — split required` (either table) must be resolved (split or DP-approved) before the plan is finalized. Per-instance fails dominate: a single agent loaded with too many distinct subjects must be split even if each individual task is small.

Rules:
- Wave 1 = all tasks with no deps.
- Wave N = tasks whose deps are all in earlier waves.
- Tasks chained within a wave (A→B) on one agent instance → note as `T{n}→T{m}` in the Tasks column.
- Include total elapsed estimate vs sequential.

### Task Seeding Blueprint

After `## Wave Structure`, include a `## Task Seeding Blueprint` section in π. This is the machine-readable input for `/implement` task seeding.

```markdown
## Task Seeding Blueprint

<!-- Used by /implement to seed TaskCreate calls on session start.
     Format: T{n} | agent-instance | blockedBy | subject
     blockedBy refs T-numbers within this list (not session task IDs).
     Agent instances are named (tester-A/B, backend-dev-A/B/C, devops-A/B)
     so parallel tasks map to distinct spawned agents.
     Seed in wave order; within a wave all rows are parallel (∥). -->

### Wave 1 — no deps, {K} agents ∥

| Task | Agent instance | blockedBy | Subject |
|------|---------------|-----------|---------|
| T1 | tester-A | — | {subject} |
| T2 | backend-dev-A | — | {subject} |

### Wave 2 — after Wave 1, {K} agents ∥

| Task | Agent instance | blockedBy | Subject |
|------|---------------|-----------|---------|
| T3 | devops-A | T2 | {subject} |
| T4 | tester-A | T3 | {subject} |
```

Rules:
- One row per micro-task (including RED-GATE sentinels).
- `blockedBy` = comma-separated T-numbers (within this blueprint, ¬task IDs).
- `agent-instance` = named instance; same instance = same agent session in `/implement`.
- Tasks that chain sequentially on the same agent instance (T11→T12) still get separate rows.
- Wave heading comment states the trigger condition so `/implement` knows when to start each wave.

## Step 6 — Approve + Commit

→ DP(A) complexity, τ, task count, agents, consistency, slices.
Options: **Approve** | **Modify** | **Return to spec**

On Approve → **immediately** continue to 6a (seed tasks), 6b (persist IDs), 6c (commit). ¬stop between substeps.

### Step 6a — Seed Claude Code Tasks

∀ micro-task in π:

```
TaskCreate(
  subject: "{task description}",
  description: "{files}\n\nVerify: {verify_command}\nExpected: {expected_output}\nRef: {pattern_file}\nSpec trace: {spec_trace}",
  activeForm: "{present-continuous form}",
  metadata: {
    kind: "plan-task",
    issue: N,
    plan: "{path to π}",
    slice: "V{n}",
    wave: {wave number},
    phase: "RED|GREEN|REFACTOR|RED-GATE",
    agent: "{agent type}",
    agent_instance: "{tester-A|backend-dev-B|devops-A|…}",
    subject: "{auth|cache|http|parser|…}",
    spec_trace: "{SC-N or U1→N1→S1}",
    difficulty: {1-5},
    parallel_safe: {true|false},
  },
)
```

Cache returned id in {task# → task.id} map. Attach `agent_instance` from blueprint row to metadata so `/implement` can group tasks by agent session.

**Dependencies:** ∀ micro-task: `TaskUpdate(id, addBlockedBy: [deps...])` where deps come from the blueprint's `blockedBy` column — map T-numbers to real task IDs using the cache.

Fallback (no blueprint): derive from phase order within a slice (GREEN blocked by RED, RED-GATE blocked by all RED in slice).

τ=S → still seed tasks (3–6 is typical). Skip wave/blueprint wiring when π has no slice structure.

### Step 6b — Persist Task IDs in Artifact

Append a `## Task IDs` section to π before committing:

```markdown
## Task IDs

<!-- Generated by /plan. Used by /implement to resume tasks on session restart. -->
- T1: {task_id} — {subject}
- T2: {task_id} — {subject}
...
```

This lets `/implement` re-attach to tasks after a session restart (TaskList would return empty for new sessions).

### Step 6c — Commit

`git add artifacts/plans/{N}-{slug}-plan.mdx` + commit per CLAUDE.md Rule 5.

## Edge Cases

Read [references/edge-cases.md](${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/references/edge-cases.md).

## Safety

1. ¬`git add -A` ∨ `git add .` — specific files only
2. ¬create issue without user approval
3. Always present plan (2f) before writing artifact
4. Show full task list (¬truncate) when |tasks| > 30

## Chain Position

- **Phase:** Build
- **Predecessor:** `/spec` (artifact: `artifacts/specs/{N}-{slug}-spec.mdx`)
- **Successor:** `/implement` (auto-chain after approval)
- **Class:** gate (user approval of plan artifact required) → adv (auto-chain to `/implement`)

## Task Integration

- `/dev` owns the dev-pipeline task lifecycle externally
- This skill does NOT update its own dev-pipeline task
- Sub-tasks created: plan-tasks (one per micro-task, `kind: "plan-task"`) via Step 6a, IDs persisted in artifact's `## Task IDs` section (Step 6b)

## Exit

- **Approved via `/dev`:** run Steps 6a/6b/6c (seed tasks, persist IDs, commit) → return silently. ¬ask "proceed to /implement?". `/dev` re-scans and auto-chains to `/implement` **in the same turn** (no second prompt).
- **Approved standalone:** print one line: `Approved. Next: /implement --issue N`. Stop.
- **Modify requested:** loop in-skill, re-present.
- **Rejected/aborted:** return → `/dev` marks task `cancelled`.
