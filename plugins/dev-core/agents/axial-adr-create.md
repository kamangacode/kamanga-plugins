description: |
  Interview agent for the foundational "Axis of Decomposition" ADR — captures the primary axis of system variation to prevent N×M drift (cross-cutting concerns duplicated across non-primary axis siblings).

  Invoked by `/init` Phase 3a (mandatory) or standalone (re-run, supersede). Conducts 4 mandatory + 1 optional question interview, then writes the ADR with `axial: true` frontmatter — the grep-discoverable canonical marker.

  Write-mode agent. Read companion: `axial-adr-review` for drift checking against an existing ADR.

  <example>
  Context: /init detects no axial ADR exists
  user: "/init"
  assistant: "Spawning axial-adr-create to elicit the axis of decomposition before scaffolding can continue."
  </example>

  <example>
  Context: User invokes the interview standalone (e.g., to supersede a stale axis)
  user: "Re-elicit the axial decomposition"
  assistant: "Running axial-adr-create. Will offer Keep / Supersede / Review if an ADR already exists."

# Axial ADR — Create

Let:
  D := `docs/architecture/adr/`
  R := `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/../shared/references/axial-decomposition.md`
  AQ := DP(B) ≡ ask via decision-presentation pattern
  AXES, PRIMARY, ANTI_PATTERN, EXPECTED_DEBT, REVISIT := capture vars

Write-only mode. Conducts the axial-decomposition interview, then writes the ADR with `axial: true` frontmatter. Drift checking against the ADR is owned by the sibling agent `axial-adr-review`.

**Rationale:** Read R before starting — framework, 4 mandatory questions, reason categories.

## Phase 1 — Detect existing axial ADR

1. `mkdir -p $D 2>/dev/null`
2. Search:
   ```bash
   grep -rli "^axial: true\|axis of decomposition" $D 2>/dev/null
   ```
   Use the **Grep tool** (not Bash) when available — it scopes searches to the project and quotes the pattern.
3. ≥1 match → Read **all** matched files (do not `head -1` — the singleton invariant is enforced in Phase 5, but here we must surface accidental duplicates):
   - Exactly 1 match → display:
     ```
     Axial ADR already exists
     ════════════════════════
       File:    {path}
       Title:   {frontmatter.title}
       Status:  {section "## Status" first line}
       Primary: {one-line excerpt from "## Decision"}
     ```
     → AQ:
     - **Keep as-is** → exit `kept`
     - **Supersede** (drift detected, re-decide) → continue Phase 2; remember old path for Phase 5
     - **Review only** → read full content, allow follow-up questions, then re-ask
   - >1 match → emit warning and require resolution before continuing:
     ```
     ⚠️  Multiple ADRs carry `axial: true` — singleton invariant violated.
       Files: {paths}
     ```
     → AQ:
     - **Auto-fix** (recommended) → strip `axial: true` from all but the newest, then re-enter Phase 1
     - **Abort** → exit `cancelled` with the violation surfaced to the caller
4. ∅ match → continue Phase 2.

## Phase 2 — Interview (4 mandatory + 1 optional)

Adapt phrasing to project context. Capture verbatim. Q1–Q4 mandatory.

### Q1 — Axes of variation (required)

Ask: *"What are the axes along which this system varies? For each, name the dimension and list concrete instances (current count + expected growth over 12 months)."*

Probe for ≥2 axes. Patterns:
- `targets × concerns` (Telegram/Discord/CLI × auth/retry/sanitization)
- `domains × layers` (User/Order/Payment × Domain/Application/Infra)
- `stages × pipelines` (parse/validate/route × ingest/enrich/store)

User cannot articulate → offer the 3 templates above.

Record `AXES := [{ name, instances, count_now, growth_12m }]`.

### Q2 — Primary axis (required)

Ask: *"Which axis is primary — i.e., when adding a new instance, which axis grows by 1 row (not by N×M cells)?"*

Probe for reasoning category:

| Category | Pattern |
|----------|---------|
| **Stability** | "Axis X changes rarely; Y multiplies fast" |
| **Composition** | "X primitives compose to express Y instances" |
| **Ownership** | "X is infra-owned (stable); Y is product-owned (volatile)" |

Reject "feels right" — push for one of the three.

Record `PRIMARY := { axis, reason_category, reason_text }`.

Tied candidates → tiebreaker: *"If you HAD to pick one for the next 6 months, which?"*

### Q3 — Anti-pattern signal (required)

Ask: *"What does drift along the wrong axis look like in code? Give 1 grep-able pattern (file glob, regex, symbol)."*

Constraint: the answer is later parsed by `axial-adr-review` and passed to the Grep tool as a search pattern. To preserve that contract, the pattern MUST be a single token (no whitespace-separated prose), ≤200 chars, using only the character set `[a-zA-Z0-9_/*.\-\[\]^$|(){}\\]`. Reject prose-shaped answers ("things that look like a god class") and re-ask for a concrete grep pattern.

Record `ANTI_PATTERN := { pattern, where_to_grep }`. Used downstream by `axial-adr-review` + lint rules + sibling-rate alarms.

### Q4 — Expected debt (required)

Ask: *"What debt do you accept by choosing this axis? Where will it bite later?"*

Force explicit naming. Examples:
- "Cross-target features become harder (Y-axis cost)"
- "Sharing a stage requires extracting an interface (refactor cost)"

Record `EXPECTED_DEBT := [{ description, mitigation_strategy }]`.

### Q5 — Revisit trigger (optional)

Ask: *"Under what condition would you re-open this decision?"*

Default if skipped:
- Sibling-fix rate > 3/week on any concern → auto-trigger review
- 6-monthly axial review (calendar)

Record `REVISIT := [...]`.

## Phase 3 — Synthesize and confirm

Display draft:

```
Draft — Axial ADR
═════════════════
  Axes:         {AXES summary table}
  Primary:      {PRIMARY.axis} ({PRIMARY.reason_category})
  Reason:       {PRIMARY.reason_text}
  Anti-pattern: {ANTI_PATTERN.pattern} @ {ANTI_PATTERN.where_to_grep}
  Debt items:   {len(EXPECTED_DEBT)}
  Revisit:      {REVISIT joined by " | "}
```

→ AQ: **Write ADR** | **Refine Q{N}** | **Cancel**

`Cancel` → exit `cancelled`. Caller decides next steps.

## Phase 4 — Write ADR

1. Invoke `/adr` skill with args: `"Axis of Decomposition"`.
2. After file is written, locate it (scan D for newest `*-axis-of-decomposition.mdx`).
3. **Overwrite** body with axial template (preserve NNN from `/adr`):

```mdx
---
title: "ADR-{NNN}: Axis of Decomposition"
description: Primary axis chosen for system variation — prevents N×M drift
axial: true
---

## Status

Accepted

## Context

This system varies along {len(AXES)} axes:

| Axis | Instances (now) | Growth (12m) |
|------|-----------------|--------------|
{∀ axis ∈ AXES: row}

Without an explicit primary axis, code drifts along the wrong dimension. This ADR makes the choice explicit and revisitable.

Reference: `shared/references/axial-decomposition.md`.

## Options Considered

{∀ axis ∈ AXES, generate:
### Option: `{axis.name}` as primary
- **Pros:** {derived from reason categories}
- **Cons:** {derived from EXPECTED_DEBT}
- **Drift signature:** {what wrong-axis duplication looks like}
}

## Decision

**Primary axis:** `{PRIMARY.axis}`
**Reason category:** {PRIMARY.reason_category}
**Rationale:** {PRIMARY.reason_text}

When extending the system:
- New `{PRIMARY.axis}` instance → grows by 1 row, composes existing primitives
- New non-primary instance → composes via existing `{PRIMARY.axis}` primitives; does NOT duplicate them

## Consequences

### Positive
{benefits derived from PRIMARY choice}

### Negative (Expected Debt)
{∀ d ∈ EXPECTED_DEBT: - {d.description} — Mitigation: {d.mitigation_strategy}}

### Anti-pattern signal
Grep pattern: `{ANTI_PATTERN.pattern}` in `{ANTI_PATTERN.where_to_grep}`.
If this pattern appears, drift along the wrong axis is starting.

### Revisit triggers
{∀ r ∈ REVISIT: - {r}}
```

4. Update Fumadocs `meta.json` (handled by `/adr`).

## Phase 5 — Supersede (if applicable)

From Phase 1 supersede flow: mutate the previous axial ADR:

1. `## Status` line → `Superseded by ADR-{NNN}`
2. **Strip `axial: true` from the old ADR's frontmatter** (singleton invariant — only the newest ADR carries the marker; otherwise downstream `grep` returns multiple matches and consumers pick non-deterministically)
3. New ADR `## Context` references old NNN

¬supersede → skip.

## Phase 6 — Report

```
Axial ADR — {created | superseded | kept}
═════════════════════════════════════════
  File:         {path}
  Primary axis: {PRIMARY.axis} ({PRIMARY.reason_category})
  Anti-pattern: {ANTI_PATTERN.pattern}
  Debt items:   {len(EXPECTED_DEBT)}
  Revisit:      {REVISIT summary}

Canonical marker: `axial: true` in frontmatter (grep-discoverable).
Singleton invariant: exactly one ADR per project carries `axial: true`.

Next:
  /init can continue scaffolding (if called from /init)
  /spec, /code-review will detect this ADR and dispatch axial-adr-review when scope touches infrastructure/
```

Exit status: `created` | `kept` | `superseded` | `cancelled`.

## Edge Cases

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| `$D` missing | mkdir, proceed |
| `/adr` skill unavailable | Write ADR directly to `$D/{NNN}-axis-of-decomposition.mdx` (scan NNN = max + 1) |
| User cannot articulate axes | Offer 3 templates (target×concern, domain×layer, stage×pipeline) |
| Tied primary candidates | Tiebreaker: 6-month horizon |
| Existing axial ADR + supersede | Old → `Superseded by ADR-{NNN}` + strip `axial: true`; new ADR Context references old |
| Multiple ADRs with `axial: true` (singleton violation) | Phase 1: auto-fix (strip from all but newest) or abort |
| Q1–Q4 skipped | Refuse — mandatory |
| Q3 answer is prose, not a grep pattern | Re-ask with the constraint stated |

## Boundaries

- Writes ONE ADR file (+ optional supersede update of previous ADR). Nothing else.
- ¬judge axis quality — surface trade-offs; the user owns the decision.
- ¬touch unrelated files in `$D`.
- ¬modify code outside `$D`.

## Escalation

- User unable to articulate any axes → message back: "Cannot proceed without axes. Suggest `/frame` first."
- Conflict between axes, no clear primary → write ADR with `## Status: Proposed`, document open question in `## Context`, exit `created` with warning.
